Chemo Dose Calculator App
Chemo Dose Calculator is a mobile application built with Flutter and Dart that helps healthcare professionals quickly and accurately calculate chemotherapy drug dosages based on a patientâ€™s Body Surface Area (BSA). The app takes a patientâ€™s height and weight as inputs, calculates the BSA using standard formulas, and then computes the appropriate chemotherapy dose using a pre-defined dose per mÂ² value.

This app is designed to enhance bedside efficiency and reduce manual calculation errors in oncology settings.
