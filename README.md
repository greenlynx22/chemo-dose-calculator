Chemo Dose Calculator App
Chemo Dose Calculator is a mobile application built with Flutter and Dart that helps healthcare professionals quickly and accurately calculate chemotherapy drug dosages based on a patientâ€™s Body Surface Area (BSA). The app takes a patientâ€™s height and weight as inputs, calculates the BSA using standard formulas, and then computes the appropriate chemotherapy dose using a pre-defined dose per mÂ² value.

This app is designed to enhance bedside efficiency and reduce manual calculation errors in oncology settings.

âœ¨ Features
âœ… Input patient height (cm) and weight (kg)

âœ… Automatic BSA calculation using Mosteller formula

âœ… Chemo dosage calculator based on BSA and dose per mÂ²

âœ… User-friendly and responsive UI built with Flutter

âœ… Optimized for quick use in clinical environments

ðŸ“± Built With
Flutter â€“ Cross-platform UI toolkit

Dart â€“ Programming language for Flutter development

ðŸ’¡ Why This App?
In oncology, accurate chemotherapy dosing is critical for treatment efficacy and patient safety. This app simplifies the process by:

Eliminating manual BSA calculations

Standardizing dosage outputs

Supporting clinicians in fast-paced clinical settings
